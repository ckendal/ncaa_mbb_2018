# NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament 2018: The Coin-Flip Bracket

This year for the big college basketball tournament, I decided to use a **stochastic process** (i.e. *random process*) to fill out my bracket.

You can view my complete bracket here:

To accomplish this, I used a random number generator (**rng**) to simulate flipping a fair coin, that is one with 50/50 chance for each outcome.
